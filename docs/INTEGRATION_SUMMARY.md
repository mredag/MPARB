**Intake Webhooks**: ⚠️ **CONFIGURATION NEEDED**
- Instagram Intake: Accepts GET (verification) ✅, POST configuration needed
- WhatsApp Intake: Accepts GET (verification) ✅, POST configuration needed

### Workflow Connections Verified

All workflows are properly connected via webhook calls:

- **Instagram Intake** → **Processor** → **Instagram Sender**
- **WhatsApp Intake** → **Processor** → **WhatsApp Sender**  
- **Google Reviews Intake** → **Processor** → **Google Business Profile Sender**
- **Error Handler** captures failures from all workflows

### Correlation ID Tracking

Correlation IDs are properly tracked across all workflow steps:

- ✅ Generated in intake workflows
- ✅ Passed through processor workflow
- ✅ Logged in database operations
- ✅ Included in error logs
- ✅ Used for end-to-end request tracing

### Database Integration

All required database tables and columns are properly defined:

- ✅ **messages** table with correlation_id, platform, response_time_ms, outcome
- ✅ **reviews** table with correlation_id, review_id, response_time_ms, outcome  
- ✅ **errors** table with workflow, node, message, payload
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance optimization

### Error Handling Integration

Comprehensive error handling is implemented:

- ✅ Error trigger captures all workflow failures
- ✅ Database logging for all errors
- ✅ Slack alerting for critical failures
- ✅ Correlation ID tracking in error logs

## 🌐 Webhook URLs for Platform Configuration

### External Platform Webhooks

Configure these URLs in your platform developer consoles:

**Instagram Webhook URL:**
```
https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/instagram-intake
```
*Configure in Meta Developer Console > Instagram > Webhooks*

**WhatsApp Webhook URL:**
```
https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/whatsapp-intake
```
*Configure in Meta Developer Console > WhatsApp > Webhooks*

**Google Business Profile:**
- Uses scheduled polling (5-minute intervals)
- No webhook URL configuration needed

### Internal Webhook URLs

These are used internally by the system:

- **Processor:** `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/processor`
- **Instagram Sender:** `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/sender-instagram`
- **WhatsApp Sender:** `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/sender-whatsapp`
- **Google Business Profile Sender:** `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/sender-gbp`

## 🔄 Message Flow Verification

### Complete End-to-End Flow

1. **Message Received** → Platform intake workflow
2. **Normalized & Logged** → Database insert with correlation_id
3. **Policy Check** → 24-hour window validation (Instagram/WhatsApp)
4. **AI Processing** → OpenAI analysis and response generation
5. **Platform Routing** → Appropriate sender workflow
6. **Message Sent** → Platform API call
7. **Response Logged** → Database update with outcome and timing
8. **Error Handling** → Automatic error capture and alerting

### Correlation ID Tracking

Each message flow maintains a unique correlation_id that allows:

- End-to-end request tracing
- Performance monitoring
- Error debugging
- Audit trail maintenance

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### System Startup

```bash
# Start all services
make up

# Import all workflows
make import

# Activate all workflows
make activate

# Verify system health
make logs
```

### Platform Configuration

1. **Meta Developer Console (Instagram & WhatsApp):**
   - Configure webhook URLs
   - Set verify tokens
   - Enable required permissions

2. **Google Business Profile:**
   - Set up API credentials
   - Configure location access
   - Enable review notifications

3. **OpenAI:**
   - Configure API key
   - Set usage limits
   - Monitor token consumption

4. **Slack (Optional):**
   - Create webhook URL
   - Configure alert channels
   - Test alert delivery

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are configured:

- `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` - Your n8n instance URL for webhook generation
- `WEBHOOK_URL` - Base URL for external webhook access (should match N8N_WEBHOOK_URL)
- `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` - Unified Meta webhook verification token (replaces FB_VERIFY_TOKEN and WA_VERIFY_TOKEN)
- `FB_PAGE_TOKEN` - Facebook Page access token
- `WA_PERMANENT_TOKEN` - WhatsApp permanent access token
- `WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` - WhatsApp phone number ID
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key
- `POSTGRES_*` - Database connection details
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack webhook URL (optional)

**Important:** Legacy `FB_VERIFY_TOKEN` and `WA_VERIFY_TOKEN` variables are deprecated and ignored. Use only `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` for both Instagram and WhatsApp webhook verification.

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Message processing time (target: <10 seconds end-to-end)
- Success/failure rates by platform
- OpenAI API usage and costs
- Database performance and storage
- Error frequency and types

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Monitor database growth and cleanup old records
- Review and update response templates
- Check API rate limits and quotas
- Update OpenAI prompts based on performance
- Review error logs and fix recurring issues

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving messages:**
   - Verify webhook URLs in platform consoles
   - Check n8n service is running and accessible
   - Validate verify tokens match

2. **Messages not being sent:**
   - Check API tokens and permissions
   - Verify sender workflow configurations
   - Review error logs for API failures

3. **Database connection issues:**
   - Verify PostgreSQL service is running
   - Check connection credentials
   - Ensure database schema is created

4. **OpenAI API failures:**
   - Check API key validity
   - Monitor rate limits and quotas
   - Review prompt configurations

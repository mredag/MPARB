# Current System Issues & Action Items

**System Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** (7/8 tests passing)
**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025

## üîç Identified Issues

### 1. **Processor Workflow Response Issue**
**Priority**: üü° **MEDIUM** - Affects response generation

#### Problem
The processor workflow returns HTTP 200 but with empty response body, indicating potential issues with:
- OpenAI API integration
- Response formatting
- Error handling in processor workflow

#### Investigation Needed
- Check OpenAI API key validity and quota
- Verify processor workflow execution logs
- Test OpenAI API connectivity independently

#### Impact
- System accepts messages but may not generate proper responses
- Affects end-to-end message flow completion
- Does not block basic system functionality

---

### 2. **Sender Workflow Correlation ID Tracking**
**Priority**: üü¢ **LOW** - Audit trail enhancement

#### Problem
Validation warnings indicate missing correlation ID tracking in sender workflows:
- `sender_instagram.json`
- `sender_whatsapp.json` 
- `sender_gbp.json`

#### Solution Required
Add correlation ID logging to sender workflows for complete audit trail.

#### Impact
- Incomplete end-to-end tracing
- Reduced debugging capabilities
- Does not affect core functionality

---

### 3. **Production Deployment Requirements**
**Priority**: üü° **MEDIUM** - Required for live operation

#### Current Limitation
System runs locally with `localhost` URLs, not accessible by external platforms.

#### Requirements for Production
1. **Public Domain**: Deploy to server with public domain name
2. **SSL/TLS**: Configure HTTPS for webhook endpoints
3. **Platform Configuration**: Update Meta Developer Console with production URLs
4. **DNS Configuration**: Ensure proper domain resolution

#### Impact
- Cannot receive real messages from Instagram/WhatsApp
- Limited to local testing and development
- All business logic functional, just needs external connectivity

## ‚úÖ **Resolved Issues**

### ‚úÖ Webhook POST Method Configuration (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Instagram and WhatsApp intake workflows rejected POST requests
- **Solution**: Added `httpMethod: "GET,POST"` to webhook nodes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully resolved and validated

## üîß **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Processor Response Issue**
```bash
# Check OpenAI API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# Check n8n processor logs
docker-compose logs n8n | grep processor

# Test processor workflow directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/processor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"test","platform":"instagram","correlation_id":"test-123"}'
```

### **Workflow Debugging**
```bash
# Access n8n UI for workflow debugging
open http://localhost:5678

# Check workflow execution history
# Navigate to: Executions tab in n8n UI

# View detailed execution logs
# Click on any execution to see step-by-step results
```

### **Database Verification**
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker exec -it multi_platform_postgres psql -U postgres -d multiplatform_auto_response

# Check message logs
SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

# Check correlation tracking
SELECT correlation_id, platform, outcome FROM messages WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL;
```
